Freecut v0.1g

Free firmware replacement for Cricut(tm) Personal paper cutter.

*******************************************************************************
IMPORTANT: REPROGRAMMING THE AVR WILL PERMANENTLY ERASE YOUR ORIGINAL FIRMWARE 

         !!! THERE IS NO WAY TO GET THE ORIGINAL FIRMWARE BACK !!!

*******************************************************************************

Original firmware cannot be copied from another machine (it has been
locked and cannot be read from the CPU)

Original firmware cannot be restored through any PC application used for
normal firmware upgrades.

This Freecut firmware has only been tested on the machine that I have. It
may not work on your machine.  It may cause permanent damage, and it
will certainly void your warranty.

Freecut cannot read your original cartridges and may never read them in
the future.

Cricut is a trademark of PROVO CRAFT. 

Freecut is not a PROVO CRAFT product. Freecut was developed completely 
independently, without any documentation to PROVO CRAFT products, and without
any original firmware. If you have problems with Freecut, do not consult
PROVO CRAFT. 


If you still want to proceed:

Attach an AVR programming cable to atmega128:

 PIN |  ISP   ||  AVR   | PIN 
-----+--------++--------+------  
  9  |  MISO  ||  PDO   |  3
  7  |  SCK   ||  SCK   |  11
  1  |  MOSI  ||  PDI   |  2
  5  |  RESET ||  RESET |  20
  10 |  GND   ||  GND   |  22/53

And upload the freecut.hex file.

After reprogramming, the machine should beep, and display "Freecut v0.1g" on the LCD display.
Use keypad to load/unload paper (bottom right is unload, one to the left is load)

Use the USB cable to communicate (speed and pressure dial work, the rest plus keypad not).

USB uses 115200 baud, 8N1.


Following gcodes are available:

G4 Px
	wait for x milliseconds

G91
	relative positioning

G90
	absolute positioning (default)

G0 Xx Yx Zx Fy
G1 Xx Yx Zx Fy
